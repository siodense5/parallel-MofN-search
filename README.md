# parallel-MofN-search
Decompositional rule extraction method for neural networks. Binarizes continuous activation values using information gain and searches through a set of MofN rules relating input and output neurons in a layer. Uses a simple loss function weighing the complexity and accuracy of the rules to choose the optimal rule to each output neuron.
